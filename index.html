	<h1>Cool Facts</h1>
        <h2 class="center"> Are pandas considered bears? </h2>
        <p>Scientists have used DNA to find out that the giant panda is more closely related to the other bears than to the raccoons. Giant pandas are in the family Ursidae with the seven other bear species. Raccoons are in the family Procyonidae, along with ring-tails and coatis.</p>
	<h2>Why is there braille on a drive up ATM?</h2>
	<p>Drive up ATM buttons contain braille because U.S. regulations require it. The ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities says, <q>Instructions and all information for use of an automated teller machine shall be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with vision impairments.</q></p>
	<h2>Where was beer invented?</h2>
	<p>In Mesopotamia (Ancient Iraq), early evidence of beer is a 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honoring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, which contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread. It is [like] the onrush of Tigris and Euphrates.</p>
